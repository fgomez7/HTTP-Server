Who put you up to this? One last chance. Who? ( Sighs ) ( Scoffs ) It was Alvarez. Los Odios, out of Peru. They paid me to set up your nephew. And I did. ( Bell dinging ) ♪ ♪ ( Bell dinging ) ♪ ♪
Alvarez, we know. Los Odios, we know. Was anyone else involved? ♪ ♪ ( Scoffs ) Him? You think... the Chicken Man? ( Chuckles ) ♪ ♪ What a joke.
Alvarez has been paying me for years... years. But you know what? I would've done it for free, because I hate every last one of you psycho sacks of sh¡t. ♪ ♪ I opened Lalo's gate.
